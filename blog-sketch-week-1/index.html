        <p>
          Ubuntu is a complete Linux operating system, freely available with
          both community and professional support. The Ubuntu community is built
          on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should
          be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by
          people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that
          people should have the freedom to customize and alter their software
          in whatever way they see fit.
        </p>
        <ul class="info-list">
          <li>
            Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for
            the “enterprise edition”, we make our very best work available to
            everyone on the same Free terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ubuntu includes the very best in translations and accessibility
            infrastructure  that the Free Software community has to offer, to
            make Ubuntu usable by as many people as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ubuntu is shipped in stable and regular release cycles; a new
            release will be shipped every six months. Every two even years an
            Ubuntu long term support (LTS) release will become available, that
            is supported for 5 years. The Ubuntu releases in between (known as
            development or non-LTS releases) are supported for 9 month each.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ubuntu is entirely committed to the principles of open source
            software development; we encourage people to use open source
            software, improve it and pass it on.
